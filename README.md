# Project2SpaceQuiz
# I created a quiz that has 4 questions with 4 possible answers for each.
# The score adds up to 100 with each question giving 25 points
# There are 5 images used as a response to your achieved score (none.jpg, low.jpg, avg.jpg, above.jpg and perfect.jpg) and 1 image used on the website for the space theme (space.jpg)
# I used a series of YouTube videos as a tutorial for my project:
